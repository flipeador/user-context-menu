> [!NOTE]
> - An application can only register a single root command in the modern context menu.
> - Subcommands which themselves have subcommands are not [yet?] supported by Windows Explorer.
>
> This app already supports separators and submenus within submenus; in case support is added in the future.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from the [Releases][releases] page.
2. Unzip the file and execute `Install.ps1` or `Install.bat`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During installation:
> 1. If the Windows settings opens, enable [Developer Mode][devmode] before continuing.
> 2. Confirm the installation of the digital certificate when prompted.
>
> After installation:
> - You may need to restart Windows Explorer for the commands to appear. [^1]

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the following installed if something appears not to be working:
> - [Microsoft .NET 9 runtimes][netrt].
> - [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable][mvcpp].
>
> You may need to install the second one if you are testing the app on [Windows Sandbox][wsb].
>
> The `Install.ps1` file generated by Visual Studio works with `powershell.exe`. \
> Try executing `Install.bat` if you get an error, in case you are using [`pwsh.exe`][pwsh].

> [!TIP]
> You can easily check the latest version from within the application:
> - The current version is right below the preview image on this page.
> - The version of the app you have installed is displayed in the window [title bar][titlebar].
> - The app includes a [WebView][webview], used for quick help and to navigate to this page.

## Documentation

Below is a brief description of some of the less obvious features.

You can quickly access some help documents directly from within the app.

The configuration is stored in the local folder; there is a button on the UI to open it. \
The `commands.json` file stores all commands; remember to make a backup just in case.

All [file paths][fpathfmt] have their environment-variable strings [expanded][expenvstr] for the current user. \
Relative paths are converted to absolute paths by searching the `PATH` environment-variable.

<details>
<summary><h3>Verbs</h3></summary>

Specifies the action to be performed on the file to execute. \
The set of available verbs depends on the particular file or folder.

A special verb `MsgBox` has been added to make it easy to test your commands. \
Instead of executing the specified file, it will simply display an informational message.

The `RunAs` verb is enforced when the user invokes the command while pressing
<kbd><kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd></kbd>. [^2]

<summary><h3>Variables</h3></summary>

The variables described in the tables below can be specified in some controls.

You can also specify user and system variables; see [`environment-variables-editor`][envvars].

#### General

The background path is empty in locations such as `This PC` and `Quick Access`. \
To display the context menu in these locations, enable `Unknown` in **Match type**.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`%:LOCAL%`][local] | The app's local data folder path. |
| [`%:INSTALL%`][install] | The app's install folder path. |
| `%:DESKTOP%` | The desktop folder path for the current user. |
| `%:BACKGROUND%` | The location where the menu is invoked. |
| `%:ICON%` | The command light/dark icon. |

The following variables can be specified in **Title**, **Command line** & **Arguments**:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`%:PARENT%`][parent] | The path of the parent path. |
| `%:PATH%` | The path of the file or directory. |
| [`%:NAME%`][name] | The name of the file or directory. |
| [`%:STEM%`][stem] | The filename without the final extension. |
| [`%:EXT%`][ext] | The file extension path component. |

The following are the default values for **Command line** & **Arguments**:

| Command line | Arguments | W. Directory | Multi mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"%:PATH%"` | N/A | ANY | `Off` |
| `%:PATH%` | `"%:PATH%"` | ANY | `Each` |
| `%:PATH%` | `"%:NAME%"` | EMPTY | `Join` |
| `%:PATH%` | `"%:PATH%"` | NOT EMPTY | `Join` |

#### Dialogs

The following variables can be specified in **Command line** & **Arguments**:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%:FILE[:<filename>:]%` | Present a dialog box for selecting a single file. |
| `%:FOLDER[:<filename>:]%` | Present a dialog box for selecting a single folder. |
| `%:FILESAVE[:<filename>:]%` | Present a dialog box that offers to save a file. |

The operation is aborted and the command is not executed if any of the dialogs are canceled.

The working directory is used as [the folder][setfolder] that is always selected when the dialog box is opened.

The `filename` parameter specifies [the default file name][setfilename] that appears when the dialog box is opened.

Examples: `%:FILE%` `%:FOLDER:%:NAME%:%` `%:FILESAVE:Document.txt:%`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Match type</h3></summary>

Specifies where the context menu should be displayed.

| Match type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `File` | The selection consists of one or more files. |
| `Drive` | The selection consists of one or more drives. |
| `Directory` | The selection consists of one or more folders. |
| `Unknown` | Unknown location (e.g. `This PC` and `Quick Access`) |
| `Desktop` | The actual desktop; not displayed in the file explorer.  |
| `Background` | The background directory; no files or folders selected. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Match name</h3></summary>

Specifies inclusion and exclusion [RegEx][regex] filters on the name of the selected items.

This is especially useful to display the context menu depending on the file extension.

For example, the following regular expression is for [raster images][raster]:

```
\.(jpe?g|gif|tiff?|a?png|webp|avif|jxl)$
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Multi mode</h3></summary>

Specifies the behavior when multiple items are selected.

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Off` | Hide the command if `>1` items are selected. |
| `Each` | Execute the file individually for each selected item. |
| `Join` | Execute the file once; items are concatenated with a space. |

The arguments are useful when using the `Join` mode.

For example, if you need to prefix the items with `-f`:

> File: `app.exe` \
> Command line: `-xyz %:PATH%` \
> Arguments: `-f "%:NAME%"`
>
> Result for two items: `app.exe -xyz -f "x.txt" -f "y.txt"`

If `%:PATH%` is enclosed in double quotation marks in the command line, the result will be:

```bash
# Probably not what you want.
app.exe -xyz "-f "x.txt" -f "y.txt""
```

Therefore, avoid double quotation marks with `%:PATH%` in the command line when using `Each` and `Join` modes .

</details>

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not modify the `commands.json` file in the local folder with a text editor; \
> invalid formatting or incorrect values may cause problems with Windows Explorer.

## Build

Stack: [WinUI][winui] 3, [.NET 9][net9] (C#), C++23.

Enable [Developer Mode][devmode] on your system if you haven't already done so.

Install [Visual Studio][vs] 2026; add the workloads and components required for [developing with WinUI][winuigs] & C++.

[Download][downl] or [clone][clone] this repository to your local computer, open [`UserContextMenu.slnx`](src/UserContextMenu.slnx) with Visual Studio.

Create a self-signed certificate for app package [signing][signing]:
1. Open [`Package.appxmanifest`](src/UserContextMenuApp/Package.Release.appxmanifest) from the [Solution Explorer][solexpl] in Visual Studio.
2. Go to the **Packaging** tab, click **Choose Certificate**, then click **Create...**
3. Follow the instructions; save the `PFX` certificate and make sure it is selected.

Install the [NuGet packages](src/UserContextMenuApp/UserContextMenuApp.csproj) for the `UserContextMenuApp` project:
> Visual Studio → Tools → Options… → NuGet Package Manager \
> Package Restore
> - [x] Allow NuGet to download missing packages.
> - [x] Automatically check for missing packages during build.

Increase the `Identity` version number in [`Package.Release.appxmanifest`](src/UserContextMenuApp/Package.Release.appxmanifest) if needed.

Select the **Release** configuration, right click the `UserContextMenuApp` project and **Pack** it.
